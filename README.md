# MSc Bioinformatics with Systems Biology
This repository contains the Python module Proteogenome and a folder with proteomics data. 
These data are provided in order to test Proteogenome.


## Run the simulation
In order to run the simulation, create a woring folder.

Dowload the in the folder Proteogenome.py and the contend of TestFiles folder. 

## 1. Prepare input data with Proteogenome
1.1	Upload proteomics data

#### Folder TestFiles:
- **PoGo_peptides.bed**      :  This file contains the peptide map performed by PoGo
- **PoGo_peptides_PTM.bed**  :  This file contains the map of peptide PTMs performed by PoGo
- **proteome_test.csv**      :  This file contains a PLGS table with peptides data from MS/MS analysis
